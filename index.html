  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I am launching myself in one of the fastest developing area's of Tech. My goal is to be of worth to humanity through using Technology to improve people's lives while travel the world and meet it's people. I believe that the urge to develop myself as a human being is build on meeting new people and cultures. I have worked as an Building Information Modeller with a base in Electronical Engineering and I am currently working as an Electonical Engineer (E-plan).
    After the completion of a course on Machine Learning and Data Science I will continue to work on new cool projects to develop my skills. I will post new notebooks on my Github profile. I am also starting a new course to help me master Web Development. I believe that I can be a better programmer if I learn about more aspects of Information Technology.</p>
